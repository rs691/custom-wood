/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model with two primary patterns:
 * 1. Strict user-ownership for personal data.
 * 2. Public read access with administrator-only writes for shared content.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The rules are designed to be secure by default. Access is denied unless explicitly
 * granted. User data is treated as private and isolated, while application content
 * like products and events is publicly visible to all users, including those not
 * signed in.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into flat, top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data.
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly visible product listings.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Publicly visible project showcases.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Publicly visible event details.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role: Write access to public collections (/products, /projects, /events)
 *   is restricted to administrators. An admin is identified by a custom authentication
 *   token claim (`request.auth.token.admin == true`). This claim must be set by a
 *   trusted backend server.
 * - User Data Privacy: A user can only access their own document within the /users
 *   collection. Listing the entire /users collection is explicitly forbidden to
 *   prevent user enumeration attacks.
 * - Data Integrity: When a user document is created, its internal `id` field must
 *   match the document's ID in the path to ensure relational consistency. This ID
 *   is immutable and cannot be changed on update.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: Data schemas are not strictly enforced in this ruleset.
 *   This allows for rapid development and API changes without needing to update
 *   security rules for every field modification. Validation is focused solely on
 *   authorization and relational integrity.
